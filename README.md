# Layouts

Merges share_layouts and nested_layouts, making the whole layout adventure a lot more enjoyable

## Share Layouts

### Introduction

Allows Rails controllers/actions to use Trusty CMS layouts as their "layout".
content_for blocks are mapped to page parts, with the exception of :title and
:breadcrumbs, which map to their specific default tags. The default content, 
or @content_for_layout, is mapped to the 'body' part.

#### Inside a controller Controller

    SomeController < SiteController
      trusty_layout 'Layout name'

    # or

      trusty_layout { |controller| c.action_name == "index" ? "main" : "alt" }
    
    # and
    
      def delete
        @trusty_layout = 'delete'
      end
      
    end

trusty_layout takes the same options as the built-in layout.  To specifically
override the Trusty CMS layout and use a standard Rails one use 
:layout => "mine", or :layout => false for no layout, as options to render.

To choose a different Trusty CMS layout, set the @trusty_layout instance 
variable to the name of a Trusty CMS layout in your controller or view.

## Nested Layouts

### Introduction

Nested Layouts enables reuse of a top-level "master" layout (one that contains your <html> tags and the overall
structure/wrapper of your site) for several different "nested" layouts (i.e. a one-column layout and a
two-column layout).  Keep your layouts DRY!

A simple example is of the following wrapper and page layout

    <!-- Application Layout -->
    <!html>
      <body class="<r:layout />">
        <r:content_for_layout />
      </body>
    </html>
    
    <!-- Page Layout -->
    <r:inside_layout name='Application'>
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    </r:inside_layout>
    
This would render the following if Page Layout was called

    <!html>
      <body class="<r:layout />">
        <h1>Hi</h1>
      </body>
    </html>

## Haml Layouts

[http://haml-lang.com/](http://haml-lang.com/)

### Introduction

Write your layouts and radius tags in haml, with support for nested layouts and radius attributes

    // Parent Layout - with content/type set as 'haml'
    %div{:id=>"parent",:title=>"<r:title />"}
      %r:content_for_layout
      
    // Child Layout - with content/type set as 'haml'
    %r:inside_layout{:name=>"Parent"}
      %h2
        %:title

    <div id="parent" title="some title">
      <h2>
        some title
      </h2>
    </div>
        
Integrates the work of [SaturnFlyer](http://github.com/saturnflyer) creating a haml_filter on pages and snippets. Additional task involved.

changing the order which objects with this type are renders. The content is turned into html before the 
radius tags are passed.
